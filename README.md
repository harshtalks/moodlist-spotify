# MoodList Spotify App

This project is live now, and is hosted on(https://moodlist.netlify.app).

## What the hell is this web-app?

This web app uses rich Spotify APIs to fetch any authorized user's top tracks listened to in the given time period (weekly, monthly, or half-yearly) and then shows a beautiful grocery items receipt list out of it which can be downloaded by the user to share on multiple social media.

### Not enough yet:
Simultaneously, by reading top tracks listened in the time_range, top artists and the followed artists, it generated a lost of recommended songs output as
grocery list where user can download that and share on social media.

### Technologies Used
- REACT JS
- Styled Components
